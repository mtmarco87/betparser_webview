## Project Overview

BetParser WebView bridges the gap between the [BetParser Angular WebApp](https://github.com/mtmarco87/betparser_webapp.git) and Android devices by embedding the web application into a native-like environment. This app is tailored for bettors and analysts who need a reliable and efficient tool for live bets monitoring and surebets/valuebets analysis.

The app provides key features such as session persistence and improved navigation to enhance usability, making it robust for real-time betting insights. By combining simplicity with essential functionality, BetParser WebView delivers a smooth and intuitive experience for its users.

## Features

- **WebView Integration**: Displays the BetParser Angular WebApp seamlessly within an Android WebView.
- **LocalStorage Support**: Ensures user preferences and session data are preserved.
- **Session Persistence**: Saves and restores the WebView state during app lifecycle events.
- **Screen Orientation Handling**: Supports smooth transitions during screen flips.

## Environment Setup

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtmarco87/betparser_webview.git
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Android Development Tools**

   - Install the Android Development Kit (ADK).
   - Install the Android Emulator (if debugging on a PC). Alternatively, you can use ADB to debug directly on your smartphone.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Gradle will automatically handle dependencies and project setup.

4. **Configure the BetParser WebApp URL**

   - Open the file `res/values/strings.xml` located at:
     ```
     app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder URL in the `betparser_webapp_url` string with your own BetParser WebApp URL. For example:
     ```xml
     <string name="betparser_webapp_url">https://your.betparser.webapp.url/</string>
     ```
   - Save the file and rebuild the project in Android Studio.

## Usage

### How to Run

1. When building a signed APK, create a keystore for signing the app.
2. Run the app on an emulator or a connected Android device.

### Permissions

The app requires the following permission:

- **Internet Access**: To load the BetParser Angular WebApp.

## Development

### Project Structure

- **MainActivity.java**: Contains the core logic for initializing and managing the WebView.
- **res/layout/activity_main.xml**: Defines the layout with a full-screen WebView.
- **res/values/**: Contains app resources like strings, colors, and styles.
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Configures app permissions and declares the main activity.

### Technical Implementation

The app loads the BetParser Angular WebApp into a WebView. It enables JavaScript and DOM storage for a smooth user experience. The app also handles lifecycle events to save and restore the WebView state, ensuring continuity for the user.

### Debugging

1. Add a new Android Run/Debug Configuration in Android Studio, pointing to the `MainActivity` of the app.

2. If needed, open the AVD Manager in Android Studio to configure and launch an Android emulator for testing.
